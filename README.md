Genetic Algorithms
==================

Introduction
------------

Initially, I had created this tiny command-line application for an introductory 
artificial intelligence course to solve the toy n-Queens problem.

I have since started to revise my work to include more functionality at the 
command-line for the n-Queens problem as an exercise in my Java programming 
skills, working with Maven and external dependencies, as well as to build up my 
own personal software suite of algorithm implementations for future use.

Future Work
-----------

Future renditions of this package will include a toy Android application 
demonstrating the handiwork of Genetic Algorithms as applied to the n-Queens 
problem. 

I will also be making use of this algorithm in my implementation of a learning 
agent for the [Mario AI learning track](http://www.marioai.org/home).


Usage
-----

Unfortunately, at the moment this application needs a bit of work. This section 
will be updated in a couple of days.


Eclipse
-------

This project was developed in [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) (specifically 
version 4.4 Luna) and can be imported as an Eclipse project in a number of 
ways. If you have git integrated with your Eclipse environment, you can simply 
clone the repository through your favorite git tool and import the project as 
an existing project.


Version
----

2.0
